Instead, we could use online sources as references, properly cite them, and then express the ideas in our own words. This way, we learn more and produce original work we can be proud of. Let's discuss how we can divide the work efficiently to save time while maintaining integrity."

However, we agree they can be distracting. A balanced approach could be having clear rules about when and how smartphones can be used in school - perhaps allowing them during specific lessons for educational purposes, but restricting use during tests or lectures. Teachers could also educate students about responsible technology use."
