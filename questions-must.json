      "modal_answer": "Good morning/afternoon. My name is Leung Ngo Shun, but I prefer to be called Jayden. I am a diligent, curious, and creative student from STFA Lee Kam Primary School.

I have a strong passion for learning, which started with my first science experiment. I also excel in and enjoy Mathematics and English very much. This curiosity drives me to self-learn by reading books and exploring reliable websites to understand the world beyond our textbooks.

Beyond the classroom, I have learned a lot about responsibility and teamwork through my role as Head Prefect. It has taught me how to lead by example, help organize school events, and support my fellow students. This experience has made me a more confident and helpful person.

Academically, I aim to do well in all subjects, and I was ranked third in my year recently. To challenge myself further, I actively participate in academic competitions. While winning is great, I value the experience and new knowledge I gain even more.

I am very excited about the opportunity to study at a secondary school like yours, where I can contribute to the community, continue to grow as a leader, and further develop my academic passions."
